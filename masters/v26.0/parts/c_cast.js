    /* ================================================================ THE PEOPLE (the plan's §3.3, §6.1; the tracker's §5)
       Every body here was made for this chapter end to end (a reference on white in an A pose, Meshy at its highest
       settings, its rig with fingers, the library's takes and written ones: masters/v26.0/make.sh §1 to §3), prepped in
       real metres with its feet on the origin and its face along +z. Nobody is a block figure: a person is not drawn at
       all until its model has landed (v21.16).

       A PERSON is a group with the rig cloned into it and one mixer. Its takes all run, each at a weight; `take()` names
       the one that should be full and the rest ease out. A take may hold the body off its own origin (v25.5: measured
       per take, at its first moment), so each is brought back onto the person's spot as its weight rises. In a film a
       person is posed by the film's clock (`pose()`: the take and the moment, absolute, so a seek lands on the same
       picture: v6.4); in play the wall clock runs them.

       ONE SKELETON, SEVERAL SKINS (the tracker's §5 "The levels"). A person's file holds the body drawn from near by;
       `<key>m` and `<key>f` are the same body rebuilt lighter (Meshy's own remesh at 8,000 and 2,500 triangles, the
       rig laid on each by tools/riglod.mjs), and `<key>h`, for the two he speaks to face to face, is the generator's
       own model with every triangle. Each lighter or fuller skin is bound to the near body's own bones by name, so it
       wears every take and costs no skeleton; which one is drawn is chosen every frame from the lens (and so at a cut
       from the cut's own lens: v24.22), with a little slack so a person standing on a boundary does not flicker. */
